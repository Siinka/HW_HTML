        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Aiko is a Scottish straight cat with a blue-point coat and striking blue eyes. At first glance, he might seem a little grumpy 
            (he does love to voice his displeasure from time to time), but deep down, he's the sweetest and kindest cat. He loves his mom 
            and dad with all his heart, though he prefers to keep his affection subtle. His favorite pastime? Having midnight conversations
             with the moon and watching the world from the window as if he's a true night guardian.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>When the sun sets, Aiko comes alive! He’s a master of the midnight "zoomies," complete with loud songs and high-speed sprints around the house. 
        \But don't be fooled by his serious daytime demeanor—Aiko is a true explorer at heart. He loves climbing into the most unexpected spots, squeezing
         into any box or bag he can find. His fur has a special way of leaving "souvenirs" on every piece of black clothing in the house. And of course, 
         he’s got a soft spot for canned chicken and beef, but here's the kicker: he has a peculiar fondness for beer!</p>

        <h2>Favorite Food</h2>
        <p> Aiko is a discerning eater—only canned chicken and beef for this regal cat. He also has a secret: an odd but undeniable love for beer.
         It’s rare, but when he gets a sniff of that hoppy aroma, his curiosity piques!</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Favorite People</h2>
       <p>Aiko’s favorite humans are, of course, his mom and dad, and anyone kind enough to open his canned food. He shows his love in his 
        own quiet way, but trust us—his heart is full of affection for those closest to him.</p>

        <h2>Dislikes</h2>
        <p>Aiko has his limits. He absolutely cannot stand being held for more than 5 seconds—any longer, and you risk unleashing his magical 
            meow that could "explode" your eardrums. He also hates vacuum cleaners with a fiery passion and despises being left alone.</p>
